# Setup

1. Open the project in VSCode (make sure you're using Pylance, and it's configured correctly)
2. Do the following:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -e .

$ pytest tests
```

This actually works now, however holy moly it took me too long to figure it out
